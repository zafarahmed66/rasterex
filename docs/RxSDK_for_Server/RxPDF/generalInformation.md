## What You Will Find in This Document

This document will provide information about the "RxSDK PDF" component:

### RxPDF

With this object, you can:

- Merge, split, and encrypt PDF files.
- Convert PDF files of different standards to the PDF/A standard format without loss of information using the `conform` method.
- Apply Rasterex markups to a PDF file as PDF annotations using the `RxPDF` object.

### Sample Code

You will find a C# console sample that demonstrates how to convert any document to PDF and optionally add Rasterex markups (from `RxRedCOM`) either as PDF annotations or as burned-in graphics using the `RxPDF` object. The sample is named `rxPublishPDF`.

### Additional Resources

[Appendix B](/docs/RxSDK_for_Server/RxPDF/appendixes.md#appendix-b-merging-pdf-files) contains pseudo code to demonstrate how merging of multiple PDF files into a single multi-page PDF file can be done.
